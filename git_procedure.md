When working on a new feature:


1) Make sure you're starting in the development branch
git checkout development


2) Pull the latest from the development branch
git pull


3) To make your new branch (please use snake_case for consistency)
git checkout -b new_feature_name

ADD AND COMMIT LOCALLY OFTEN!

4) When your code is done, push to your new branch and enter a pull request.
git push origin new_feature_name


5) The team will review the code and if ok, merge to the development branch.
